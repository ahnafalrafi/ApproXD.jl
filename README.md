[![2D approximation](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/109115/BSplines.jl/approx.png)]()


This package implements high-dimensional approximation of real-valued functions on kronecker products of univariate basis funcitons. At the moment only spline basis functions are supported. The Basis functions are similar to what you get from the R function `splineDesign{splines}`.
